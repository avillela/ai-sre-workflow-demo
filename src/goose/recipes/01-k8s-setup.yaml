description: Create Kubernetes KinD cluster and install ArgoCD
instructions: This guide outlines how to set up and configure a computing environment using command-line tools. Tasks include the creation of a cluster using tools like 'kind' and the installation of software such as ArgoCD. The steps require executing shell commands, checking tool-specific statuses (like pod readiness), and ensuring all outputs follow the requested format—particularly ensuring responses are in valid JSON when needed. These instructions can be adapted for similar tasks by following a systematic process of deploying resources, verifying status, and formatting outputs correctly.
prompt: |
  Run this to create a kind cluster named {{ cluster_name }} and install ArgoCD. Wait until pods start showing up in the namespace. Continue wating until all pods in the argocd namespace must be in "running" status before moving on to next step. If there are no pods initially in the namespace, keep checking until they show.

  Summarize results.
