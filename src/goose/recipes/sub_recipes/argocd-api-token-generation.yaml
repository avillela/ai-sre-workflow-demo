  ## Objectives

  Your objective is to generate an ArgoCD API token for the `admin` account.

  Assume that a port-forward on port 9080 is already set.

  Steps:
  1. Log into ArgoCD using the `argocd` CLI
    * ArgoCD server: the value of the environment variable ARGOCD_BASE_URL
    * `password`: the value of the environment variable ARGOCD_PASSWORD
  2. Generate the API token
    * account: `admin`
  3. Delete the line starting with ARGOCD_API_TOKEN in {{ env_file }} if there already is one
  4. Add a key/value pair to the end of {{ env_file }}:
    * key: ARGOCD_API_TOKEN
    * value: the API token from step 2 to the end of {{ env_file }}, enclosed in double quotes
