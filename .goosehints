If helm isn't available to install a Kubernetes operator, use kubectl instead.

Always use version v1.14.3 of cert-manager.

Always use version v0.124.0 of the OpenTelemetry Operator.

Always use version v3.1.4 of ArgoCD.

Once ArgoCD pods are in "running" state, print the admin password for the ArgoCD cluster. Always print the Admin password to the console.

The ArgoCD admin password secret is located in the argocd namespace. When retrieving the ArgoCD password, it should be base64 decoded.

After installing the ArgoCD CLI, reload the bash profile manually.

Set up port-forwarding when installing ArgoCD.

Install cert-manager and the OpenTelemetry operator using kubectl.

When installing cert-manager, keep checking pod readiness status and don't move on to the next step.

When installing the OpenTelemetry Operator, install cert-manager first. Do not install the OpenTelemetry operator until all cert-manager pods have a status of "running". Keep checking and don't move on to the next step until this is met.
