title: ArgoCD port forward
description: Create an ArgoCD port forward
instructions: To establish a reliable port-forward connection between a local machine and a Kubernetes service, we utilize `kubectl port-forward`, running it with `nohup` to persist the process after logouts. We ensure outputs are redirected to a log file for monitoring, and run the command in the background using '&'. Logs can be reviewed as needed using standard shell utilities (e.g., `cat`). This process is useful for debugging, accessing services locally, or establishing a temporary connection to a cluster service. Custom ports and namespaces can be configured depending on the use case.
